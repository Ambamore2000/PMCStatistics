# PMCStatistics
Application made by Ambamore2000.

--General Information--
This java app gets track of the statistics of the amount of players
on the PMC (Planet Minecraft) website.

--What It Does--
Every 12 minutes, a directory with the date the process is running in
has 2 files created/added onto/edited, those being top.txt and stats.txt.
It adds onto the stats.txt how much players are on the website during
that time, and checks the top.txt, an easy way to check for a specific date
what was the peak point of the day.
