# PMCStatistics

# Story

My first program written in Java. I created this application to understand when it would be the best time to post on a website with a list of servers (http://planetminecraft.com) to maximize potential audiences.

# Application

This java app keeps track of the statistics of the amount of people on the PMC (Planet Minecraft) website.

Every 12 minutes, a stats.txt and a top.txt file in a directory of the date the process is executed on is edited with it's proper values; Stats.txt adding the time and amount of players, Top.txt self explanitory.
